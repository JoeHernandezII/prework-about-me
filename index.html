      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello all!  I currently work for Apple Inc. as a Senior Accessibility Advisor.  I am currently enrolled in the KU Coding Boot Camp as I've always had a passion for troubleshooting and working with computers.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Biggest hobby is during my free time, I like to adventure around the KC Metro area with my Wife and two kids.  It can be as simple as going to a park, eating at a local restaurant, or just hanging out.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p> Still on the fence a bit but feel that completing this camp and using the resources provided will point me in the right direction!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Olathe, KS</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
